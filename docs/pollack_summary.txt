I Introduction
	in a line magnets line up, on a plane, how arranged are they?
	hard to answer,  N=3 triangle is tricky
	special case of regular polygon going forward
	goals/results:
		equilibrium energy
		normal modes+w for oscillations around equilibrium
		dispersion curve
		miscellany
	simpler/other work described, implying independent validation for inspecting regular polygons
II equilibrium and normal modes of oscillation
	A potential energy of interaction
		standard mu dot B interaction
		eq1 sets it up in terms of indices of two dipoles, n and n'
		angle's phi are taken relative the displacement vector
		no relativity considered
		starting with points along x-axis and increment uniformly along
		eps_n is the angle deviation from equilibrium, which is tangent to the circle inscribing the polygon.
		eq2 expressing displacement distance based on index
		eq3 expressing phi in terms of deviations eps_n
		eq4 raw potential expressions
		eq5 power series of eq4 in terms of eps
		1 equilibrium potential
			eq6 taking advantage of symmetry to calculate one potential once
			eq7 crafting the single potential, Z_N
			eq8 the final Z_N, approaches rieman zeta at large N
		2 potential energy terms that are linear in angles
			establishing that when eps_n =0 all around, no torque
			eq9 splitting up the derivative into two terms, going clockwise and counter clockwise
			eq10 finding one term of the sum
			eq11 simplifying the term
			eq12 matching counterpart from the other direction, differs by a sign
		3 Potential energy terms that are quadratic in angles
			eq13 describing the 2nd order terms as a matrix
			eq14 showing the elements are taylor series terms
			eq15-16 explicitly calculating and stating that the matrix is highly symmetric
			eq17 stating eigenvalue problem
			eq18 taking a derivative of the unprimed eps to almost get an eigen value problem. The primed vs unprimed nature a bit of a flag for me
			eq19 explictly showing the rrelationship between eigen value and frequency
			eq20 defining a base frequency
			starting to talk about symmetry find eigen vectors
			eq21 transform matrix
			eq22 stating eigenvectors for transform matrix, elements
			using the shift matrix brings a constant term out front
			since eq21 and eq14 commute, they have the same eigenvectors
			eq23 the eigenvalues are the result of large sum
				maybe the complex parts wash out because n-n' has equal amounts on both sides?
				why is it a sum?
					oh, it's just the explicit statement of vector transformation
			eq24 substituting in to get the full form with rho and Z_N


	B normal modes of oscillation
	C Equilateral triangle and square arrays
