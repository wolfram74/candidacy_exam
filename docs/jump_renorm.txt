Rough impressions:
	an interesting technique, but not seeing how it's a group theory application
I: introduction
	claims to be able to analyze the jump discontinuity with group symmetries
	particularly the CD leg in figure 1
	jumps occur when frequency of driving is shifting in time.
II: quartic oscillator: comparitive study in methods
	instance of standard SHO with a quartic term at scale lambda
	eq1 potential energy
	eq2 equation of motion
	eq3 total energy and peak energy
	eq4 vel(x)
	eq5-7 finding period vs amplitude
	eq8-10 doing perturbative analysis
	eq11 identifying divergences that we want to eliminate, namely set a pair of cosines to 0?
	eq15-19 sort of explaining multiple time scale analysis
