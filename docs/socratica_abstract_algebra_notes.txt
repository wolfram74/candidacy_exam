group definition:
	IS
		set of elements
		operator
		associative under this operator
		closed: 2 elemets generate 3rd
		identity element exists
		each element has a pair (inverse) that combines to make identity
	NOT necessarily
		commutative

Subgroup definition:
	H =< G IF
		H's elements subset of G's elements
		consequence
			|G|%|H|=0
abelian <> operation commutative
coset definition:
	a set generated by multiplying every element in H by some constant
	note: cosets won't have identity

building a quotient group
	start with a group
	select a subgroup
	build cosets until original group is covered
	if each of the elements in these sets can act like elemnts of a group, it's a quotient group

homomorphism vs isomorphism
	iso is a stronger claim than homo
	both are maps from one group to another group.
	both preserve group relations IE if A*B=C then F(A)XF(B)=F(C)=F(A*B)
	isomorphisms are also 1-1 and thus
		don't reduce order of the group
		are reversible?
	kernel of a morphism is the set of elements that are reduced to the identity in the new group. kernel is not just as subset, but also a subgroup

order of element
	some element x^n might be the identity, in which case it has order n
	identity always has order 1
	in S3 elements with a flip are all order 2, while pure rotations are order 3

ring's are
	sets of elements closed under two operations
		which form a group under one of the two operations
		and at least distributive under the 2nd operation
