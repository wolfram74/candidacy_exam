neat things
	Group theoretical analysis for MHD flow fields: a numerical result

not uncommon for bulk of presentation to be mostly just one paper, so focusing mostly on two isn't too bad


The rubric does include considerations for well written, readability is part of writing well.

The rubric also asks for a "Discussion" I did not think it necessary to  insinuate I needed to define a discussion. I am also very curious about how 2/3s of the diagrams in yours and Mr. Morgan's papers are identical, hand drawn and lacking any citation.

I'm more sympathetic to questions asked before submission than complaints after grading.
