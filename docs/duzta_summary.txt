1: introduction
	galileian equivalence
	kind of a big jump from "math let's us do physics" to "constant acceleration is thus"
	eq01 v(t)
	eq02 x(t)
2: group theoretical approach
	justifying group theory in physics, may check references for better paper, maybe?
	u is some point in phase space U
	eq03 group element phi_t acting on point u_t0 definied
	eq04 kind of feels like putting the cart before the horse here, just restating eq1,2
	eq05 group operation established
	eq06 identity property claimed to be non-trivial
	eq07 then goes and shows it, hand waving a bit along the way
	how to interpret negative time operations ruminated on
	2.1: generalization to project motion
		adding horizontal motion to the picture
		eq08 yep
3: Group orbit, physical orbit and unphysical solutions
	eq09 orbit being the set of points achievable by operations on the group
	orbits are either identical or completely disjoint
	physicality is defined as whether or not we care about the times involved
	the times are a property only of labels, so negative time could be perfectly plausible

4:
	eq10 constant jerk equations
	eq11 demonstrating that phi_t is not trivially invertible like in constant acceleration case.
	that fact should be gone into more detail, elaborate on what about the 2nd order differential equation lends it to this effect, but not the 3rd. :grumble grumble:
