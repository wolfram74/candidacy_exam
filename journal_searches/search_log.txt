Group theory and the vibrating polygon (1972, NAO)
	the complimentary partner to the magnetic polygon paper

Zero eigenfrequencies in the vibrating polygon
	exploring some of the unstable states associated with vibrating polygon

Vibrations of rotating circumferentially periodic structures (1981, NAO)
	fairly general treatment, but special case for regular polygon, 0-frequency mode transforms into non-0 frequency mode after some critical rotational frequency

Freezing phase transition in a fractal potential
	over a finite region of space a fractal potential is applied, a non-zero temperature ground state is observed? possibly non-physical since at some point a fractal potential would cave

Local entropies across the Mott transition in an exactly solvable model
	some kind of Solid state paper involving coupled states?

Ground state solutions for a semilinear elliptic problem with critical-subcritical growth
	existence proof for semilinear elliptic problems? might need some definitions

Existence and concentration behavior of solutions for a class of quasilinear elliptic equations with critical growth
	more treatments in special families of equations? Advances in non-linear analysis might be a neat journal to narrow search

Quasi-Periodic Solutions for Differential Equations with an Elliptic-Type Degenerate Equilibrium Point Under Small Perturbations
	solutions for some differential equations that may be applicable?

The general equilibria of a spinning satellite in a circular orbit
	assuming very general conditions, apparently only the fairly conventional conditions are stable satellite behavior.

On the stability of poincaré periodic solutions of harmiltonian systems
	general stability conditions for 2 DOF systems. (NAO)

Periodic solutions of the N-body problem

Dynamics of a Lorenz-type multistable hyperchaotic system (2018)
	tweaks lorenz system to give it a curve of equilibria, observes numbers of behaviors. ***

Ground states of stealthy hyperuniform potentials: I. Entropically favored configurations
	a stat mech paper exploiting new frameworks to double check some numerical stuff, kinda wanna read it more thoroughly just to figure out what a stealthy potential is

A new Lorenz-type hyperchaotic system with a curve of equilibria (2015)
	very very similar abstract to the 2018 one, still, of interest

Lorenz equations part I: Existence and nonexistence of homoclinic orbits
	an analysis of the parameter space and which ones lead to chaos/homoclinic orbits

A shooting approach to chaos in the Lorenz equations
	interested in it for the numerical method, never taken the time to try shooting approaches

Simple chaotic flows with a line equilibrium
	looking for systems with line equilibria

TITLE-ABS-KEY ( wavelet  AND pitch  AND detection )

Performance evaluation of a wavelet-based pitch detection scheme
	claims auto-correlation is best for it's metrics, followed by wavelet and then cepstral techniques

Pitch estimation of speech and music sound based on multi-scale product with auditory feature extraction
	including a model of how the ear  works improves pith detection results? should compare what other techniques it's used against. might be interested in noise model

Contribution to the multipitch estimation by multi-scale product analysis
	extracts two pitches, compares results with other methods (might be more useful)

A corroborative study on improving pitch determination by time–frequency cepstrum decomposition using wavelets
	claims a wavelet packet specialized for pitches

Multi-pitch estimation based on multi-scale product analysis, improved comb filter and dynamic programming
	yet another approach, also being tested on speech vs instruments...

Quantification of Symmetry
	defines a 0-1 value of symmetry that a hamiltonian has, claims to be good for inspecting "extended group" and since  DoS isn't always singly valued, also identifies some symmetry breaking

Particle on a Ring Spectroscopic Selection Rules Determined by Group Theory
	Presents a symmetry analysis of particle in a ring, shows how valid transitions occur

Complete spectrum of the infinite- U Hubbard ring using group theory
	replicating previous results in one place. A chemistry problem I am too unfamiliar with the nomenclature to meaningfully summarize

Translational transformations of tensor solutions of the helmholtz equation and their application to describe interactions in force fields of various physical nature
	given a tensor solution to the helmholtz equation, this paper describes translation transformations.
	owTranslation is meaningless in free space, so this must refer to ways to shift with regards to boundary conditions?

interpretation of the spectra of polyatomic molecules by use of group theory
	provides some of the basic background for using group theory for intepretation.
