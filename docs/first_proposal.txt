In "Magnets at the corners of polygons" (Stump, Pollack and Borysowicz) Stump et al. do analysis on the normal modes of oscillation for dipoles placed at the vertices of a polygon using fairly standard energy considerations. In "Group Theory and the Vibrating Polygon" Perrin derives similar properties for a polygon comprised of ideal springs and masses at the vertices using primarily group theory arguments. While both systems have very different interaction origins, they have identical symmetry properties. How would Perrin's technique differ when applied to Stump et al.'s system? Could it produce all the same results?
