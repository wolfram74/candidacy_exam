1: introduction
	because group theory is useful in quantum vibrations, maybe it'll be useful in classical vibrations
	often group theory is qualitatively useful, here we get some juicy quantitative radness
	while this is a new solution, it's more the technique we're interested in
	citation 4 for small oscillations
2: general formulation
	n masses with n springs in an n-gon
	displacement is fully general, x-y, -> eta 2n dimensional vector
		note: odds are x's, even's y's, coordinate vector is 1-indexed
	eq1 standard kinetic energy, slightly wibbly potential energy
		why the trig functions?
			kind of see they force things to be exclusively compressive
			p=1 just on the x-axis, movement along y has no contribution
			I'm sort of seeing what they're getting at, not super thrilled
	eq2 taking the sums and making em vectors
	eq3 taking the double sum making em a matrix operation
	eq4 the various terms for the potential expanded out
		some terms seem more complicated because they include two sides of the interaction xp appears as itself, and as an xp+1 for the previous xp.
	eq5 the result of making the lagrangian and eqn of motion off screen
	eq6 establishing what the eigenvalues would be
	eq7 simply stating the eigenvalue problem
	goes into reminding the audience about change of basis so the spring matrix is /just/ eigenvalues
	eq8 recasting T and V in the preferred coordinates
3:symmetry considerations
	while equations present do provide enough information to find the eigenvalues, more is available to use
	some elaboration on what symmetry means in this context
	eq9 linear transformation definition of symmetry
	some of the properties and changes the transformation S must cause
	V and V' must be identical up to relabeling?
	eq10 S and V thus are commutative
	some claims about how eigen vectors with the same eigen value form a space that transforms like an irreducible representation of a group
4: The symmetry groupf D_n of the regular polygon
	group in question is the dihedral group
	R is the smallest rotation (2pi/n)
	E is the identity
	P is inversion/mirroring
5: The representation D
	table 1 character table for Deven group
	table 2 character table for Dodd group
	talking about representations and equality under transformations

	eq16
	eq17

7: the case of n Even

8: Discussion

TO LOOK UP
	group action is kind of like a function that
	http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GroupAction.html
		takes elements of a group that
			can act on a set
			and when acting on the set maintain group properties
		and returns however the element permutes the set

	irreducible representation of a group

		particular kind of representation of group
